abstract = {High accuracy 3D surface information is required for many construction robotics tasks such as automated cement polishing or robotic plaster spraying. However, consumer-grade depth cameras currently found in the market are not accurate enough for these tasks where millimeter (mm)-level accuracy is required. This paper presents SL Sensor, a structured light sensing solution capable of producing high fidelity point clouds at 5Â Hz by leveraging on phase shifting profilometry (PSP) codification techniques. The SL Sensor was compared with to two commercial depth cameras - the Azure Kinect and RealSense L515. Experiments showed that the SL Sensor surpasses the two devices in both precision and accuracy for indoor surface reconstruction applications. Furthermore, to demonstrate SL Sensor's ability to be a structured light sensing research platform for robotic applications, a motion compensation strategy was developed that allows the SL Sensor to operate during linear motion when traditional PSP methods only work when the sensor is static. Field experiments show that the SL Sensor is able to produce highly detailed reconstructions of spray plastered surfaces. The robot operating system (ROS)-based software and a sample hardware build of the SL Sensor are made open-source with the objective to make structured light sensing more accessible to the construction robotics community.}
